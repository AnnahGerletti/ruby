#adding uses + 
# + can also be used to combined things 

p 3 + 4 # adds them together 

#subtract uses - 

p 3 - 2

#multiplication uses * 

p 3*4

#divide uses / - but Ruby will return a full integer will not print remainders. 

p 4/2
p 562/5

# to see the correct decimeal result need to make one of integers a decimeal

p 562.0/5

#exponents is expressed with **

p 2 ** 4
# two to the power of four


#Modulous opperator will return the remainder of the opperation. 
# Modular sign same in Ruby % 

p 5 % 2 # 5 / 2 return 2.5 but module will output 1
